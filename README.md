# Car Price Prediction  
ðŸš— Project Type: Machine Learning Regression  
ðŸš— Dataset: [Car Data CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars/data)  
ðŸš— Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn   

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features using linear regression. I built two models: one from scratch, and one using Scikit-learn to compare performance.  
Features considered include:  
ðŸŒ¸ Present Price  
ðŸŒ¸ Driven Kilometers  
ðŸŒ¸ Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, Others)  
ðŸŒ¸ Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)  
ðŸŒ¸ Seller Type (Dealer/Individual)  
ðŸŒ¸ Number of Owners  
ðŸŒ¸ Year of Manufacture  

## Objectives  
ðŸš— Understand and explore the car pricing dataset  
ðŸš— Perform data cleaning and remove duplicates  
ðŸš— Conduct EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
ðŸš— Visualize key patterns (fuel type, transmission, selling type, etc.)  
ðŸš— Handle categorical features with one-hot encoding  
ðŸš— Compare a linear regression model built from scratch with Scikit-learnâ€™s version  
ðŸš— Evaluate models using RÂ², MAE, and MSE  
ðŸš— Visualize predictions vs actual selling prices  

## Project Files  
This repo includes the following files:  
ðŸš— car_price_prediction.ipynb:  
The full Jupyter Notebook version of the project. Contains all code, plots, and markdown explanations in one place. Run it using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.  
ðŸš— linear_regression.py:  
My custom implementation of linear regression.  
ðŸš— car_price_prediction.py:  
This is the Python script version of the project. Contains the same code as the notebook, but without the markdown explanations.  
ðŸš— car data.csv:  
The dataset used for training and testing the models.  

## Final Thoughts  
This project was a full walkthrough of the regression workflow and building a model from scratch was especially satisfying, as it deepened my understanding of gradient descent, loss functions, and weight updates.
In the future I would want to work on implementing this with different models to see which one can provide better accuracy.
